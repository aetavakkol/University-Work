Sploit 1:
Honestly, this one took a little while just because I was trying to get used to the enviorment. I knew right away that we had to overflow buf from what I had in target1.c so I found the address of buf. Thankfully, I had used memcpy and memset before frequently in OS the semester before so I decided to use those functions instead of using another array to hold the argument. Other than that, everything was pretty straight forward. As stated before, Sploit 1 just allowed me to reintroduce myself to the enivorment.

Sploit 2:
I knew that Sploit 2's general code would be similar to that of Sploit 1. I figured out that I needed to take advantage of the 1 byte from the target2.c file. Then, I actually physically drew the frame and figured out the range that we needed to avert to and chose 0xD0 accordingly. Other than that, finding the actual addresses for buf, eip, and ebp was trivial.
