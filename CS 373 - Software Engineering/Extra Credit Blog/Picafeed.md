Picafeed is a fun and personal way to share your moments with your friends. Capture a photo, video or screenshot and send it to a friend or your feed. (But here’s the catch) They’ll view it and then only you can see it. It’s being social all over again. This is a new form of social media that focuses on Creating the moment of holding the picture, this new way of sharing focuses on making things more personal while keep things in real time. The beauty behind it is to live in real life, in the moment, all the while sharing with those you love and the world around you.
