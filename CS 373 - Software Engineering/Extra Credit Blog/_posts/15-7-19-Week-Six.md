title: WEEK SIX
---

Warning: this week's post is entirely about Bootstrap because I needed a place to tak about it.

WHY - that's all I can ask myself as I'm redoing the entire front-end. We used a free Bootstrap template that we found online for Phase I and II but we wanted something more for the final submission. Only one person on our team had used Bootstrap before but he covered the back-end for the projects. There was admittedly a small learning curve but it's actually really easy to pick up. You really just have to dive into the entire Bootstrap experience if you want to learn quickly, and I feel as though I've only eaten and breathed-in Bootstrap/CSS/HTML/Javascript for the past three days. 

Seriously, WHY? I don't know what convinced me to write custom CSS and Javascript files when it wasn't even required. I think that the lessons learned here are that: 1) it's okay to use templates and 2) don't write trivial code when you don't have to. 

However, it was an awesome learning experience and I noticed that I've started to become a better programmer thanks to this class. For example, given our time crunch, I might have used the style attribute to assign attributes straight to a class on html files like this before: 

```<div class="name" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"></div>``` 

but I found myself unable to do that anymore. I forced myself to do it the "proper" way. Boy, those assigned readings really get to you. 

####**Tip of the week:**
[WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/) is a javascript plugin that uses Animate.css to help you customize animation settings. It's definitely an added feature and you don't need to use it but I found it pretty cool to use. It honestly brought the entire project together and gave it a little wow factor (pun intended), at least on the front-end.
