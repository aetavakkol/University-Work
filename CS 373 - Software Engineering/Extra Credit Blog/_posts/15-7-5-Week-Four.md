**TEST:**
The tests aren't meant to be straight forward so you can't just memorize functions. For example, he will specifically say that you can't use a certain property of iterables. Go in with this mindset: the top three [common] solutions that you come up with within the first five minutes of reading each question won't be usable. In the best and worst way possible, it honestly felt as if I was at a technical interview. 

**PROJECT - GENERAL:**
Professor Downing gave us about 20 minutes during class on Wednesday to get together with our groups, or to join one if we hadn't already. We spent that time getting our final member and discussing our project ideas. This helped us to progress rather quickly since we had already planned to meet after class that day. We seemingly spent much of our time trying to come up with a team name more than anything else after class but we actually got quite a bit done. By the end of the first day we had already gotten the models done, scraped our data, set up django, and set up the repository with issue tracker to divide up our work. 

**PROJECT - TECHNICAL REPORT:**
I have always considered myself a good writer but there's always a bit of extra pressure added when you're writing with the purpose of others possibly using your work in the future. I guess I never gave it much thought but now that I think about it, there must have been someone behind every documentation - whether it's for a language or for an API.  

**TIP OF THE WEEK:** Never forget what resources are available to you. The IMDB repositories are public so take a look at some of the old ones if you have no idea where to get started. My partners and I were confused on how to approach writing the unit tests so we looked around and got the general idea in a matter of minutes.
