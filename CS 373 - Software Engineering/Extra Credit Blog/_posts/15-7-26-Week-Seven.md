title: WEEK SEVEN
---

It's over! Well, besides the last test tomorrow, but it's over! Everything went by incredibly quickly but I learned so much. 

####**Presentations:**
What I found most interesting about the project presentations was that though we were all given the same tools and requirements, there were a lot of variations as to how the groups used them. For example, some used dataTables straight from Bootstrap, others from Ajax, and others from the jQuery UI plugin, as was the case for our group. Also, it was really unfortunate that Professor Downing couldn't be there on either days. I'm sure that he must have had other important matters to attend to but it was really deflating to walk out after presenting, having unable to show off our hard work to 'The Man'. On the other hand, him not being there made us bond as a class, as we asked each other questions after each presentation.

####**Final Words:**
This is one of the very few class that you absolutely **must** take as a Computer Science undergrad, otherwise you're not getting your money's worth. The department basically makes it impossible for you to graduate on time anyway so take your time and get into this class whatever it takes. You're not just turning in some trivial "find the nth Fibonacci term" projects here; you're not taking exams that test if you read the book(s) or not; you won't want to browse Facebook to get through boring lectures. This class makes you a better programmer and a better problem solver, whether you like it or not. 

####**Tip of the week:**
Again, speaking as a front-end developer for the projects, I have two tips:

1) [LayoutIt](http://www.layoutit.com/) is a Bootstrap interface builder. I found it a bit late into the game and wasn't able to use it, though.

2) [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) was a life saver. It lets you test your JavaScript, CSS, HTML or CoffeeScript online. You can take the examples given on Bootstrap's documentation pages and edit them straight on JSFiddle before using them.
