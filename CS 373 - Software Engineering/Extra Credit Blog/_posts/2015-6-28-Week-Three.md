##**Me:** Omg, Netflix! 
##**Netflix:** You were thinking it!
##**Me:** I know but you said it!

I was watching "White Chicks" a few days ago for what seemed like the 20th time and I couldn't help but to feel a rush of satisfaction when I saw that Netflix's suggested rating matched mine - five stars. It makes you really appreciate the current algorithm that's being used. Of course, judging from the caches and the reported RMSEs, none of us used an algorithm anywhere as complicated but if you're interested in algorithms as I am, you should check out the released papers on it. Moving on, though...

###**I. Finally. Understand. Iterators. And. Iterables.** 

...and it only took me a week and a half, just in time for the test.

Thankfully, Professor Downing likes to tie examples from Python to other languages that helps a great deal when trying to grasp new concepts. "This is like lists and list iterator", "you could do this in Java but Python doesn't like that", etc. And being that I'm more comfortable in C and C++ <del>and since I have something against Java</del>, I especially appreciate that he doesn't just stick to Java examples, as many UTCS professors tend to do that. 

####**Tip of the week:** Here's a [@link](http://www.bogotobogo.com/python/pytut.php) to the site that I've been using for outside Python references. It seems like a given, but I find that it helps if you read up on the material before lectures and ask questions about stuff you might not have fully understood.
