title: WEEK FIVE
---
**PROJECT:**
It was absolutely hectic trying to get everything in order before submission on Tuesday night. It was a constant exchange of "Hey, did you run Pydoc" to "Did you leave meaningful comments in that file" to "Did we get enough words in for the technical report?" Slack, the "real-time messaging, archiving and search [application] for modern teams" was a life saver. I couldn't imagine having gotten everything done in time had we been group texting. I have used other apps such as Trello before for team settings but that's more of a To-Do list maker, whereas Slack is more for messaging. I do wish that 1) Slack could incorporate something of a check list capability and that 2) the starred topics/comments were universal, though.

Otherwise, it's really key to pick a team where each member can contribute something original; you don't want three of the five members to be front-end oriented. What's great about our team is that each of us set off to do what we're strongest at - one of us had a background in data scraping, one of us knew databases and django, one of us had an inkling for APIs, etc. At no point did our interests converge and I think that's the true reason we were able to knock out work so quickly. 

**LECTURES:**
We're going over SQL. It's nice to come into this class having already taken databases. There's not much else to say other than that it's interesting to see the python equivalents to SQL commands. 

**TIP OF THE WEEK:** 
[Creately](http://creately.com/diagram-type/use-case) is a great tool to use to create Use Case Diagrams. It's not explicity required to include one in the technical report but it definitely helped us to finalize our site's purpose.
