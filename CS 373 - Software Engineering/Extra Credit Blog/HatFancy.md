* [Hat Fancy](hatfancy.me)
* **Team:** ItTakesFiveToDjango
* **Purpose:** Series of educational projects for CS373: Software Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin with Professor Glenn Downing in summer 2015. Our goal was to "create a Web app hosted on Rackspace that emulates IMDB to track something" (source). We executed the project in term of three phases.

* **Role:** Front-end, Bootstrap, 

### Target Market:
Dota 2 players commonly trade and sell items that they have acquired. This project's goal is to provide a gateway to a database that lists the price data of these items, among other things. Appropriately, the data will be sortable by "Hero", "Set", and "Item". Admittedly, there are many marketplaces such as Dota Trade and Dota Market to sell and purchase items but the information available is cluttered and often times incomplete.
